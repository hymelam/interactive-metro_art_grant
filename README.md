# Interactive Visualization of Nashville Metro Arts Grant Award History

This Shiny app displays the top 10 recipients of Nashville Metro Arts grants for years between 1988 and 2017. It contains a slider input that can be used to filter the results by year(s), which dynamically updates the visualization.

This repository contains the R code and .csv file used to create the app.
